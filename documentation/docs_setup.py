Azure Machine Learning Environment Setup and Usage Documentation

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and using the Azure Machine Learning (AML) environment. Follow the steps below to configure your environment and start leveraging AML for your machine learning projects.

Prerequisites:
1. An active Azure subscription.
2. Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning concepts.
3. Azure CLI installed on your local machine.
4. Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python installed.

Setup Steps:

1. **Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace**
   - Open Azure Portal and navigate to "Create a resource".
   - Search for "Machine Learning" and select "Machine Learning".
   - Click "Create" and fill in the required details:
     - Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
     - Resource group: Create a new resource group or select an existing one.
     - Workspace name: Provide a unique name for your workspace.
     - Region: Select the region closest to your location.
   - Click "Review + create" and then "Create".

2. **Install Azure Machine Learning SDK**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Create a new virtual environment (optional but recommended):
