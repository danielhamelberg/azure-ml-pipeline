# Azure ML Model Training Setup

## Description
This project provides a comprehensive setup for training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models using Azure Machine Learning. It includes scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/danielhamelberg/azure-ml-model-training-setup.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd azure-ml-model-training-setup
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Setting Up the Environment
1. Create an Azure Machine Learning Workspace:
    ```sh
    python environment_setup/setup_workspace.py
    ```

### Data Ingestion
1. Upload data to Azure Blob Storage and register it as a dataset:
    ```sh
    python data_ingestion/data_ingestion.py
    ```

### Data Preprocessing
1. Preprocess the data:
    ```sh
    python data_preprocessing/data_preprocessing.py
    ```

### Model Training
1. Train the model using Azure AutoML:
    ```sh
    python model_training/train_model.py
    ```

### Model Evaluation
1. Evaluate the trained model:
    ```sh
    python model_evaluation/evaluate_model.py
    ```

### Model Deployment
1. Deploy the model as a web service:
    ```sh
    python model_deployment/deploy_model.py
    ```

### Monitoring
1. Set up monitoring for the deployed model:
    ```sh
    python monitoring/monitoring_setup.py
    ```
